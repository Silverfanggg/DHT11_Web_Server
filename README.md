# DHT11 Web Server with ESP32
- In this project, I used an ESP32 and a DHT11 sensor. The DHT11 measures temperature and humidity, and the ESP32 reads these values at regular intervals. Each reading is stored in a vector. The ESP32 also runs a Web Server, which displays the latest sensor data and allows it to be monitored or saved through a web interface.
